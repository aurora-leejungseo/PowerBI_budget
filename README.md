# IT Spend Visualization

Welcome to the IT Spend Visualization repository! This project is dedicated to creating a data visualization dashboard, and the main demonstration file is `budgetspendBI.pdf`, showcasing the visualization results using Power BI.

## Overview

The visualizations in this repository aim to assist business stakeholders in understanding the IT spend situation and facilitating informed decision-making.

### Visualizations

- **Page 1: Comparative Analysis**
  - Focuses on comparing actual, budget, and forecasting amounts across regions, departments, and cost elements grouped by month.

- **Page 2: Decomposition Tree**
  - Utilizes a decomposition tree to identify contributing factors for each component of the budget data.

### Interactive Features

The Power BI visualizations are designed to be interactive, allowing users to select specific components of the data for detailed exploration. Unfortunately, due to license limitations, the interactive features cannot be shared directly. Instead, the visualizations have been exported to a PDF format, which is available in this repository.

## Demo File
